# UCLQHackathon_FrustratedOnes
Submission for UCLQ Hackathon 2022 - Frustrated ones team

Optimally install renewable energy sources around the UK is a challenging problem both for policy makers and companies in the sector. 
In this submission we propose an optimization strategy to select best locations for new renewable energy sources. 
In particular, we designed an optimization problem that takes into account historical data of renewable energy production and weather parameters,
and computed a solution to this problem by using a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), targeting one of the 27 qubits devices of IBMQ.
